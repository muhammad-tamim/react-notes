# Introduction

React is a component-based JavaScript frontend library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components with efficiently update the DOM using a virtual DOM.

### The story of react:

Back in the early 2010s, Facebook engineers were in trouble. Their web applications, especially the news feed and the ads system, needed frequent updates. Every little change meant updating the real DOM directly — and that was slow, clunky, and full of bugs. The UI became harder to manage, and performance dropped.

In 2011, one Facebook engineer, Jordan Walke, decided to experiment. He built a prototype called FaxJS. The idea was bold: instead of updating the DOM directly, create a Virtual DOM — a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. Whenever something changed, compare the new Virtual DOM with the old one, and then update only the parts that actually changed in the real DOM. The results were stunning. Suddenly, apps ran smoother and faster.

By 2012, this new approach was powering Facebook news feeds and Ads, and later, Instagram. The success inside Facebook was undeniable.

Then came 2013. At JSConf US, Facebook decided to release this tool to the world. At first, developers didn’t know what to make of it. JSX — writing HTML inside JavaScript — looked strange. Some argued it broke the rules of traditional MVC (is a design pattern that separates an application into three parts: model, view, controller) patterns. A few even called it “the worst idea ever.”

By 2014, people started noticing that React apps were faster, more predictable, and easier to maintain. The component-based architecture encouraged reuse, and teams could build complex interfaces without drowning in spaghetti code.

Then came 2015, a breakthrough year. Big companies like Netflix, airBnb adopted React. The state management library Redux was released, solving complex data flow issues. React Native made it possible to use the same principles to build mobile apps for iOS and Android. Even developer tools like the React DevTools browser extension were launched, making debugging easier. React was no longer just a Facebook experiment — it was becoming the industry standard.

Over the following years, React kept evolving. Updates brought new features, performance boosts, and better developer experience. One of the biggest shifts came with Hooks (like useState, useEffect, and useContext). With Hooks, developers no longer needed class components for state and lifecycle management. Functional components became powerful and simple, and writing React apps became cleaner than ever.

From a hack at Facebook to a global phenomenon, React completely changed the way we think about building user interfaces. Today, React powers not only web applications but also mobile apps (React Native), desktop apps, and even experiments in VR.

### what is components:
A component is basically a reusable, independent piece of UI. Components can be small (like a button) or large (like a whole form or page).

### what is virtual DOM and How virtual dom work:
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory copy of the real DOM.

![image](./images/virtual-dom.png)

Here, we have a component that has a `<div>` and inside the `<div>` two elements:
- First, React creates a Virtual DOM for this component, based on the actual DOM.
- Then, when we change something—like adding a new `<h3>` element—React creates a new Virtual DOM for the updated component.
- Next, React compares the newly created Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM. This process is called diffing.
- After comparing, React updates only the parts of the real DOM that changed. This process is called reconciliation.



### library vs framework

### Create React App with Vite:

Vite is a modern build tool that offers lightning-fast startup and optimized development experience for React and other frameworks.

**Step 1: Create React App with Vite** 
```bash
npm create vite@latest project-name -- --template react
```

**Step 2:  Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd my-react-app
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite -D daisyui@latest
```

**Step 3: run you project on vs code**

```js
code .
```

**step 4: setup tailwind and daisyui:**

vite.config.js:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
})
```

Import Tailwind CSS and daisyUi to index.css:

```js
@import "tailwindcss";
@plugin "daisyui";
```

**step 5: Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

# jsx

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows you to write HTML directly inside JavaScript, enabling you to create UI components more efficiently.

![image](./images/jsx.png)


### How JSX Works:

```jsx
const element = <h1 className="title">Hello</h1>;
```

Behind the scenes, Babel (a compiler that converts JSX into JavaScript) transforms this JSX into a React.createElement:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { className: "title" },
  "Hello"
);
```

this React.createElement returns a plain JavaScript object of the translated jsx:

```js
{
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    className: "title",
    children: "Hello"
  }
}
```

React uses this Virtual DOM object, compares it with the previous Virtual DOM, determines the differences, and updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed.

### JSX rules: 

- You have include JavaScript expressions using { }: 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const name = "Tamim";
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>hello, i'm {name}.</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- JSX attributes are written camelCase (class = className, onclick = onClick)

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const name = "Tamim";
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Hello world")
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className='text-2xl font-black text-red-100'>hello, i'm {name}.</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick()}>click</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App; 
```

- css styles are written as objects.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const stylesObject = {
    color: "blue",
    fontSize: "20px"
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1 style={{ color: "blue", fontSize: "20px" }}>Hello, i'm Tamim.</h1>
      <h1 style={stylesObject}>Hello, i'm Tamim.</h1>
      <h1 className='stylesComeFormCSSFile'>Hello, i'm Tamim</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- JSX Must Return a Single Parent:

Wrong: 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {

  return (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>World</p>
  );
};

export default App;
``` 

right: 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>World</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

or use fragment:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>World</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- When rendering lists, each item must have a unique key: 

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {

  const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];

  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default App;
```

# Props, callback function, context api

### props

Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. props are read-only means a child cannot modify the props. 

Note: props is received as an object

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserInfo name="Tamim" age="20" country="BD"></UserInfo>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

const UserInfo = (props) => {
  console.log(props) // {name: 'Tamim', age: '20', country: 'BD'}

  return (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
  )
}
```

- **Passing Multiple Props:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserInfo name="Tamim" age="20" country="BD"></UserInfo>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

const UserInfo = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Name: {props.name}</h1>
      <h1>Age: {props.age}</h1>
      <h1>Country: {props.country}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **Destructuring props:**

Instead of writing props.name, props.age, etc., you can use destructuring.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserInfo name="Tamim" age="20" country="BD"></UserInfo>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

const UserInfo = ({ name, age, country }) => {

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
      <h1>Age: {age}</h1>
      <h1>Country: {country}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **Default Props:**

If a prop is not passed, you can set a default value.

```js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserInfo name="Tamim" age="20" country="BD"></UserInfo>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

const UserInfo = ({ name, age, country, single = "Yes" }) => {

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
      <h1>Age: {age}</h1>
      <h1>Country: {country}</h1>
      <h1>Single: {single}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **Props Can Be Any Data Type:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const info = {
    name: "tamim",
    age: 20,
    country: "BD"
  }

  const crushList = ["tasnim", "liya", "bithe"]

  const alertShow = () => {
    alert("Hello props world")
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ShowUserInfo info={info} single={true} hobby="Playing football" crushList={crushList} alertShow={alertShow}></ShowUserInfo>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

const ShowUserInfo = ({ info, single, hobby, crushList, alertShow }) => {

  const { name, age, country } = info;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Name: {name}</h1>
      <h1>Age: {age}</h1>
      <h1>Country: {country}</h1>
      <h1>alone: {single ? "I'm alone" : "i'm not alone"}</h1>
      <h1>Hobby: {hobby}</h1>

      <ul>
        {crushList.map((girls, index) =>
          <li key={index}>{girls}</li>
        )}
      </ul >

      <div>
        <button className='btn' onClick={alertShow}>click</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- **Children Prop (props.children):**

Special prop called children lets you pass JSX between opening and closing tags.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Card>
      <h2>This is inside the Card component</h2>
      <p>Reusable component with children props</p>
    </Card>
  );
};

export default App;

function Card({ children }) {
  return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
}
```

### Passing Data Using Callback Functions:
Props can only pass data from parent to child. But sometimes, the child component needs to send data back to the parent. In such cases, A callback function a callback function helps us to passing data from Child to Parent in React.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  function handleChildData(data) {
    setMessage(data)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Message form child: {message}</h1>
      <Child handleChildData={handleChildData}></Child>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

const Child = ({ handleChildData }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <input className='input' onChange={(e) => handleChildData(e.target.value)} type="text" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Context API
The Context API in React is a built-in feature that allows you to share data across multiple components without having to pass props manually at every level. It helps avoid “prop drilling” by creating a global context that any component can access directly.

**How to create context API:**

step 1: Create Context

```jsx
// src > MyContext.jsx

import React from 'react';

const MyContext = React.createContext();

export default MyContext;
```

step 2: Provide Context Value 

```jsx
// src > main.jsx

import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App.jsx'
import MyContext from './MyContext.jsx'


const user = { name: "Tamim", age: 20 };

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <MyContext.Provider value={user}>
      <App />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  </StrictMode>,
)   
```

step 3: use context value using useContext():

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import MyContext from './MyContext';

const App = () => {
  const user = useContext(MyContext);
  const { name, age } = user;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, my name is: {name}</h1>
      <p>I am {age} years old</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### what is the difference between props, callback function and context api

props: parent --> child
callback function: child --> parent
context api: Global (anywhere in tree)
